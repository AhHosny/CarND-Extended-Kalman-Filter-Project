# CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-P1

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

# Overview
This project consists of implementing an [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) with C++. A simulator provided by Udacity ([it could be downloaded here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)) generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object, and the Extended Kalman Filter[EKF] must fusion those measurements to predict the position of the object. The communication between the simulator and the EKF is done using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) using the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) implementation on the EKF side.
To get this project started, Udacity provides a seed project that could be found (here)(https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project).

# Prerequisites

The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
- Udacity's simulator.

For instructions on how to install these components on different operating systems, please, visit [Udacity's seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project). As this particular implementation was done on Mac OS, the rest of this documentation will be focused on Mac OS. I am sorry to be that restrictive.

# Compiling and executing the project

These are the suggested steps:

- Clone the repo and cd to it on a Terminal.
- Create the build directory: `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`: This will create an executable
  - `ExtendedKF` : EKF implementation.


## Running the Filter

From the build directory, execute `./ExtendedKF`. The output should be:

```
Listening to port 4567
Connected!!!
```

As you can see, the simulator connect to it right away.

The following is an image of the simulator:

The simulator provides two datasets. The difference between them are:

- The direction the car (the object) is moving.
- The order the first measurement is sent to the EKF. On dataset 1, the LIDAR measurement is sent first. On the dataset 2, the RADAR measurement is sent first.

Here is the simulator final state after running the EKL with dataset 1:
